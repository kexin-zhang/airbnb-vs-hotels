    "# Hotel Review Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the code used to analyze hotel reivews. The goal is to obtain a *directed sentiment score* towards specific hotel *aspects*, such as the location, room quality, or hospitality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Approach\n",
    "1. Obtain reviews for hotels\n",
    "2. Use the Stanford CoreNLP library to obtain sentiment scores for each sentence in a review\n",
    "3. Treating a sentence as a binary tree, obtain sentiment scores for each phrase (subtree) in a sentence\n",
    "4. Classify the *aspect* of each phrase\n",
    "5. Aggregate results for all *aspects*, for all hotels\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach lets me obtain directed sentiment scores for each hotel. Using this method, we can also obtain sentiment scores for several aspects, even if they appear in the same sentence or have opposite sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the sentence:\n",
    "```\n",
    "The food was great, but the staff was very rude.\n",
    "```\n",
    "The phrase \"the food was great\" has a positive sentiment towards the **food** aspect, while \"staff was very rude\" has a negative sentiment towards the **staff** aspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to CoreNLP, the overall sentiment of the entire sentence is negative. However, examining subphrases allows us to accurately measure sentiment towards each aspect individually. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Work (TODO)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Investigate weighting by probability\n",
    "2. Investigate filtering by probability\n",
    "3. Investigate using neutral sentiment reviews (currently discarded in `Sentiment.java`)\n",
    "4. Increase number of aspects\n",
    "5. Increase regex rule coverage for aspects\n",
    "6. Replace regex classifier with a neural net trained against the regex rules."
