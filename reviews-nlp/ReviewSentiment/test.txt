The start to the marathon is conveniently located to the hotel and the #1 reason why my husband and I chose to stay here. Lorenzo's had a special menu catering to runners and carbo loading was no issue! The bed was super comfortable. Great amenities such as a microwave for the early morning pre marathon oatmeal, a mini fridge to store and stock up for all the hydration needs. We were situated nicely in the corner so it was very quiet and my husband got a great night's sleep! We weren't aware that there was a special shuttle taking runners to the start and when we inquired about transportation all of the spots were taken. However, the hotel was very accommodating in providing us alternative transportation needs - one car ride to take my husband to the start line and then to bring me to the ferry so I can get back to Manhattan timely to watch the finish for the race! Overall we had a great experience.
The room fit the Hilton Garden Inn brand: superior service and attention to the customer, clean and comfortable room, and secure. I travel for business at least once a month to various hotels and can always count on the Hilton Garden Inn brand to deliver. My only complaint was parking - The night I arrived was a Friday night which coincided with weekly cabaret event, so parking was a bit tight when I arrived. Other than that, service was superior and the room was predictably clean and ready at the time of arrival (around 5pm). Also, the surrounding area is safe and would easily reconsider if I ever returned to the area.  You will need a car for all transportation needs. Public transportation besides a bus is not easily accessible to this location. 
From the moment you enter the beautiful glass lobby with the fire lit and a fresh pasty waiting for you, you are home. After a long day of business meetings, these beautiful surroundings are an oasis of calm. I stay here whenever I am in the area. I use Newark airport where a van promptly picks you up. The front desk arranges my taxi for me. The dine in restaurant has a nice menu and the food is delicious.
We stayed here before our cruise out of NJ and did the park stay cruise package. We couldn’t believe how clean and up to date the hotel was. Their free shuttle was very helpful to take you to the cruise pier or the Staten Island ferry to get into NYC. Highly recommend to cruise passengers. Will be back again. ,/Hotel_Review-g48682-d224599-Reviews-Hilton_Garden_Inn_New_York_Staten_Island-Staten_Island_New_York.html
Booked a room at this hotel because we wanted a nice place that would be relatively close to the start of the New York Marathon. This was a perfect choice! The price was right - especially when booked. The service was great, just like the breakfast we had the day before - and the festive dinner thereafter. We did not know when we booked that the hotel would offer groceries at the beginning. That was a great bonus !!! Before going to Lower Manhattan, we used the St. George Ferry, about 20-25 minutes from the hotel. The ride was easy and the ferry is free - $ 8 for all day parking. Wow! We recommend this hotel!
Friendly staff, great food, comfortable, clean and definitely a do over. I had a conference there, the place was more than ideal, everyone had a great time, location was superb. Pool was nice. A bit pricey, but hey is NY.
We were very happy here. The staff were terrific. The room was great and it was good overall value. There is a free shuttle service to the free ferry that takes you to NY. You do need to book well in advance though. We ate a few meals here - breakfast and dinner and all of them were good.,/Hotel_Review-g48682-d224599-Reviews-Hilton_Garden_Inn_New_York_Staten_Island-Staten_Island_New_York.html
I had business in NY and got extended a day, so they put me up here and I’m thrilled they did. This place is a gem in the gem that is Brooklyn, one of NY’s trendiest, hippest places to be. I’m a little too old for hip and trendy but not for being treated in a friendly manner, and everyone at this 61-room hotel (with outdoor pool/terrace that’s closed this time of year) is beyond friendly. The front desk folks are amazingly helpful; one printed out and outlined a map of places I wanted to see, going as far as to give me his Metro card that had a couple bucks left on it to replenish and use, and save the buck fee for a new one. I mean that never happens in NY, right? Wrong. One thing I’ve found about this city is the stereotype is just that, a stereotype. The reality really is different, and in particular at The McCarren. Great place, and I definitely will stay here again if my travels take me to Brooklyn. FYI, for some reason it won’t let me rate the hotel below, but the value, location and service were five star in my opinion
Easy access to NYC on subway. Room was on the small side. Water leak on our floor caused awful odor in the hall. Staff is very friendly and informative. Martin is awesome. Would stay here again based on location alone.,/Hotel_Review-g60827-d2151848-Reviews-McCarren_Hotel_Pool-Brooklyn_New_York.html
We stayed at the hotel for five days and every one was very nice and helped us in everything that we needed to stay comfortable and happy. We really appreciate the attentions of James , Martin and Miguel. We will stay again !
I chose the McCarren Hotel for my most recent stay in Brooklyn. Basically, I just needed a quiet, dark room with a comfortable bed - a place to sleep while visiting my daughter. My room was the least expensive, smallest one available. There was no view, there were great blackout curtains, and I was on a low enough floor so that noise from the rooftop bar was not an issue. It met my needs perfectly. First the pros: 1) The hotel is located within a short walk of lots of good restaurants. 2) While there’s no coffee maker in the room, free coffee and tea are available downstairs in the restaurant. 3) The bed and pillows are very comfortable, with crisp white linens. 4) There is a parking garage next door to the hotel. Although parking is not free, paying the overnight fee is cheaper and less stressful than getting a NYC parking ticket! 5) The front desk staff are friendly and helpful. 6) The stark, minimalist, modern decor isn’t my style, but the room and bathroom were updated and clean.  Now for the cons: 1) Housekeeping needs to be more attentive. My room had obviously been cleaned — the bed was made up with clean sheets and the bathroom had fresh towels. But there was food in the fridge and an article of clothing in the bathroom left by a prior guest which had not been removed. 2) The hotel is somewhat less expensive than the William Vale and the Wythe, but it has considerably less atmosphere. Overall, this is a very good hotel and I would gladly stay here again.
This hotel is in a convenient location to explore Williamsburg on foot and easily catch the subway. Great restaurants just a few blocks away and being next to the park was really nice. We enjoyed the rooftop bar and the great service by the staff. Martin, in particular, did a great job of helping us with airport rides and suggestions for places to go around the neighborhood. I would definitely come back!
This hotel is OK, but they really need to step up their game a bit for the prices they charge. No bottled water in the room, no mini bar. Front desk is located with a bar behind it and they couldn't sell me water (even though I could see it). I'm not sure the last time I was at a hotel and couldn't even buy a bottle of water. Yes, I know NYC water is decent, but the point remains. I wanted a cold bottle of water and the hotel couldn't provide it. Likewise, the radios have old iphone connectors and are dated. The USB charge port in the room didn't work. It's OK to charge a lot, but you need to work on the details when you do that.
Spent 2 nights here. Good location for Williamsburg social life. Lovely rooftop bar with views. Room was comfortable, bed a king. No coffee/ tea in room but it was accessible from the breakfast room. Nice pool area for guests that we didn't use due to the time of the year 
We booked at the Rodeway Inn as it is close to the Botanical Gardens and the Bronx Zoo-two of our main destinations. It is also close to Fordham University. The hotel was renovated 4 years ago. We were surprised as they keep it up very well. The hotel is small including the rooms. They are well appointed and clean. There is breakfast each morning. If you come towards the end then the eggs are cold. There is free parking on a first come first serve basis for a few cars. The staff are very calm and helpful. We were so grateful to Anish for all the help he gave us.,/Hotel_Review-g47369-d4447795-Reviews-Rodeway_Inn_Bronx_Zoo-Bronx_New_York.html
Good hotel, nice room with a great bed. Kind of small but it was not a problem for us. By public transport within 1h45m from JFK to the hotel. From the D-train station you can get to Manhattan within 30-50 minutes depending where you need to be. A lot of shops nearby and the area didn't feel unsafe for us, during the day there were lots of people. I wouldn't walk the streets alone at night though. Hotel breakfast was fine and frequently refilled, bagels, toast, eggs, bacon and sausages. Great stay if you don't mind the travel and looking for a budget hotel.
Chose this property because it was walking distance to the botanical gardens. Horrible unsafe location. Sure we walked to the gardens but had to stay in the hotel at night out of fear. Tiny tiny room was pretty clean but the public area smelled like smoke and carpets were dirty. TV dish reception was bad. No really decent eating locations within walking distance. Read other reviews before I book this hotel after reading positive ratings from others however no one mentioned the location issue.,/Hotel_Review-g47369-d4447795-Reviews-Rodeway_Inn_Bronx_Zoo-Bronx_New_York.html
Pros: Location within walking distance of New York Botanic Garden; helpful desk staff, modern decor; mattress comfortable; affordable by NY standards. MetroNorth train stop 10 min walk from hotel is a 20 minute ride to Grand Central Station, making travel to Manhattan easy.  Cons: Any noise at all in the hallway (and there were plenty!) is very loud----room doors are clustered together, making such noise more likely. Seriously, bring ear plugs! Breakfast was bare bones even by most breakfast buffet standards.  General: Neighborhood is mixed, some new apartment construction, a few dilapidated buildings, a police station a block away and storefronts with bars and roll-down metal doors. walked from NYBG a few times after dark and never had any unwanted attention or problems of any sort.
Newer hotel in the Bronx. The rooms are small but clean and price reasonable for the area. Lots of restaurants within walking distance and hotel offers free but limited parking and smoking rooms to avoid the cold. Nice place and would stay again. ,/Hotel_Review-g47369-d4447795-Reviews-Rodeway_Inn_Bronx_Zoo-Bronx_New_York.html
We booked this place after reading reviews on Trip Advisor and are so glad we did! We were visiting our son at Fordham University. It was a short walk to the university and we felt very safe waking to and from the hotel. Breakfast was good and included in room fee. ,/Hotel_Review-g47369-d4447795-Reviews-Rodeway_Inn_Bronx_Zoo-Bronx_New_York.html
First off, Alex was very helpful answering my questions when I first called. I had to book a room for my mother visiting the Boro as she is very familiar with the area and it's soo close to everything: Montefiore Hospital, the famed Woodlawn Cemetary, Fordham Road/ University, Bronx Botanical Gardens, and The Bronx Zoo. And so easy to get to from the Bronx River Parkway. Well I had called Alex again, and had asked if my mother could drop her things off a little earlier and continue with some errands in the area and when she got there her room was ready a lot sooner than 3pm check in. I was very grateful. Alex took all my info and emailed me a form to process payment as I didn't want my mother to be charged. The Room is very clean, and has all the amenities. The hallways nice too. There is a free continental breakfast offered in the morning. I visited mom and I really like the place. I'll be staying here when I come back to visit and my mother has become a fan as well.
A well situated hotel close to the highway and with a small parking lot at an incredible price. BUT get there early as the spaces are not illimited. The hotel is new, nicely decorated. We were on the city side not facing the autoroute so it was very quiet. Our friends were on the other side and it was not. Close walking distance to the subway and the staff is super nice and will give you all the info to get to Manhattan fast. 
I am currently staying at this property. Won't make that mistake again. Besides not being around anything at all, the hotel staff is mostly uncooperative and rude. The one elevator they do have is extremely slow. This evening, we come back to our room not being cleaned, and we weren't the only ones. My wife had to take the dirty towels down to the front desk for new ones! When she asked about compensation for this, she was told . that the manager would be notified. Horrible Customer service
We stayed here at the very last minute when in town for the Yankees and Bronx Zoo. Our original hotel didn't have hot water or the promised parking when we arrived, so we quickly made reservations at the Comfort Inn. This was the perfect place for us! The room had plenty of space, inexpensive parking inside a fenced in area, a decent breakfast and very friendly staff. The woman at the front desk that night was wonderful! As for the location- it was fine. It's the Bronx, I'm not sure what people are expecting? It was easy to get to both Yankee Stadium and the zoo from the hotel. I was also very happy with the price, not much more than we paid to stay off the highway in Pennsylvania. We would stay here again without hesitation and I would recommend it to our family.
We picked this location because we wanted to be close to Yankees stadium. The hotel is fairly new, and the property itself was nice. However, it's definitely not in the best part of town. And the walk to the subway doesn't appear to be very safe either. It was fine to walk it during the day but we didn't want to chance it in the evening. The other thing that frustrated us was the breakfast. The menu was the exact same both days we were there - and it was cold. The eggs had to be warmed up in the microwave, and the pastries were frozen. Plus the first morning we had to wait several minutes for things to be replenished. I never understand how hotels are not prepared for breakfasts when they know how many guests they have registered. There was plenty of seating, though, which was nice.
We arrived early and were able to park right on site in a handicapped spot. The staff was very helpful, room was clean and breakfast good. The nearby subway stop did not have elevators, so we had to cab to the city. We picked this hotel because we had tickets to a Yankee game.....less than two miles, but not a good walking neighborhood.  We did not use the car once we parked it, had no marks on the rental when we got it, (we had checked for marks) we found a 2 foot scratch along the back passenger door after we left the hotel (while filling the tank). Definitely keyed.  Because of this alone, I would not recommend this hotel, no security was ever seen.
We decided to stay here for it's proximity to Randall's Island Park (For Panorama Fest). It's stated as being within walking distance to two entrances to the park, and within three blocks of the Subway. Which was true. However, travel as a woman alone, I was more than a little wary of walking where I needed to be. The hotel is not in the nicest of area... That being said: the hotel is great. Clean, new, comfortable and the staff was beyond friendly and helpful. Free breakfast buffet was... well a buffet and free. Can't complain about free, right? The rooms were spacious and the beds so comfortable. I would suggest staying here with a group if you are going to be using the metro system or heading to Yankee stadium or Randall's Island. Or at least know absolutely where you are going and don't look too lost....
I have to admit, the location is perfect and the accommodations is even better. More for less...hotel luxury for motel prices. And if you're trying to impress your significant other and our friends and family from outta town w/o breaking the bank, this is the place.  And if I may I would like to especially thank a few employee's in particular... WILLIE 1st and foremost for the incredible hook up (this is especially for you), the pretty Hispanic young lady who put me on to what the 1st floor has to offer B4 I even met Willie (sorry I didn't catch your name love but you know who you are lol), and to the tall older black gentleman for being very informative abt the deals after 1 a.m. (that came in handy) You all are the real life savers!
Stayed n it was Horrible cause of people smokin Weed along wit Cigarettes which came into others next rooms as if you were smokin yourselves, no place to bring your Family with all sex n Drugs fights goin ons not to mention it's a shelter as well, no security except for the shelter if u wanna call em security they did nothing but hid in the stairwells texting or talking on their phones to hide from their DUTIES, AT all coast keep away.!!!!!
My wife stayed here on business and had a terrible experience. Sketchy area. Loud noises including people having sex, arguing and loud tv. Security in the hall gave an indication that its not very safe.  Consider somewhere else. 
New Hotel but too distant from Manhatan. The staff not soo good, the cleaning service did'nt returned after one attempt at 10 am when we were preparing to went out. About 45 minutes to one hour to get to Manhatan. In 7 days just 3 days of cleaning.
Cozy room, close to Barclays, the area has lot to eat and the hotel and the area is very safe. I will recommend everyone to live at this property. The staff is friendly and provides alot of help. Please live here.
We pulled up to the neighborhood of the hotel and realized it is in the projects of Brooklyn. Its our fault for not doing more research! The neighborhood looked extremely rough. We almost canceled our booking and went to another hotel, but we decided to just stay. When we went to the front desk some shady business was going on with the front desk person and who I would assume was a guest. We went up to our room, which did not have a ""do not disturb sign"". We went back down to ask for one and the front desk person seemed shocked that we would want one. Our room looked like it used to be ""nice"", but it smelled of smoke and had gum all over the carpet. There were cigarette ashes in toilet. We took all of our valuables with us when we left. I would suggest not leaving anything in your room of value. We could smell our neighbors cigarette smoking all night. The breakfast is absolutely disgusting. The waffle mix was sour, which I would assume meant it was bad. Bagels and bread were hard. Eggs and sausage were cold and the milk for the cereal was warm. It seemed like there were local residents/homeless people staying at this hotel too. They would leave and go to a house right next to the hotel and come back. I don't recommend this hotel to anyone!! Its not a very safe place.
Room was small, but clean and comfortable. Staff was accommodating and pleasant. No lobby area, small breakfast area that served a standard budget hotel breakfast. Rough area of Brooklyn, but was in close proximity to our business location. In room internet was good.
I have been watching reviews of this hotel! Some are good some are bad... We stayed 2 nights prior to a cruise. I have only very good things to say about the stay..Staff was wonderful. Rooms were very nice. We will stay here again next year.,/Hotel_Review-g60827-d2309186-Reviews-The_LOOK_hotel_Red_Hook_an_Ascend_Hotel_Collection_Member-Brooklyn_New_York.html
Inconvenient location, few amenities. Unless you Uber or take taxis, it's inconvenient. Not near subways or restaurants. When it was a Comfort Inn, they had a shuttle. No more. Used to have free breakfast. No more. Used to have free coffee or tea in the lobby. No more. No coffee pot in the room. Room was clean, but Spartan. Bed was comfortable. Towels were large. Power went out in the bathroom the morning we were leaving. Must have been an omen.
Very nice hotel. Love the wood floors in rooms. Very friendly folks at reception. Max was so friendly, as was Kimberly. Jose, the bartender was absolutely the best. Great dinner recommendations and conversation and warm host. We would definitely come back. 
We booked this hotel nearly a year ago, to be near the cruise terminal, and have written confirmation of such. Just been advised that they will not honour our reservation because of an error in their reservation system! Without checking with us they booked us into another hotel some 12 miles away stating that they are excited to host our visit (what utter BS). We had to cancel that and make more sensible arrangements. When I spoke to the manager I didn't get the impression that he cared at all. With their attitude I couldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.
Enjoyed the BAR downstairs - nice opportunity to try some local craft brews. The elevator was painfully SLOW. I was working the Formula E Race and we were walking distance (6 blocks) to our Entrance. We also found a number of good food options in the neighborhood.,/Hotel_Review-g60827-d2309186-Reviews-The_LOOK_hotel_Red_Hook_an_Ascend_Hotel_Collection_Member-Brooklyn_New_York.html
. As we were departing the next day on a cruise we sought out the closest hotel to the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in Red Hook, NY and chose the Look Hotel, Red Hook, an Ascend Hotel member formerly known as the Comfort Inn, Red Hook. The hotel is located in a not too salubrious area, but it is very close to the terminal. Upon arrival we were greeted by a pleasant lass named Kim who quickly looked after our checking in and answered many questions. Our room on the third floor has recently undergone renovations and it is small but charming. The bathroom is surprisingly large with a bath and a shower, large soft fluffy towels and 0inch flat screen TV, that bizarrely enough cannot change channels from sitting in bed; you have to stand in front of the TV to change channels. The room also has a safe and a fridge and adequate hanging space. The hotel also as excellent, fast in room Wi-Fi. Oddities included a toilet seat with no lid and a towel rail 2” above cistern lid. This I am sure will be changed as the refurb continues. Breakfast consisted of bagels, juice and coffee/tea. As we booked our room last year when it was the Comfort Inn, free breakfast was included. Since the change of ownership, we were given a credit of $10 each, which meant our breakfast of two juices, two bagels and two coffees came to $20.50, so we only paid 50c. A bargain for what we had. All in all a charming hotel, very reasonably priced and yes, we would definitely stay here again,
I am a travel agent from Seattle, Washington and a few weeks ago, my friend and I stayed at the Opera House Hotel for three nights. Who said a trip to NY has to cost a fortune? The Opera House Hotel was fabulous! After full days of sight seeing, the front desk staff at the property greeted us each and every time we walked through the doors. It was like coming home to family! The rooms are huge, spotless and beautifully appointed - and the king size bed was the best I've ever slept in! With me being a travel agent, I have stayed in MANY properties around the world, so I can honestly tell you that this is the absolute truth! The property also serves a nice continental breakfast each morning, however, If you want to get a ""local"" taste of the Bronx for breakfast, just go around the corner on Willis Avenue and you can check out the Coffee Delight Diner! Where else you can get a full breakfast for two for $12.00?? Great service too! I would definitely recommend this hotel for your stay in NY! The subway station is a stones-throw away and you can travel to any part of the city you need to get too. Keep in mind, the Bronx is kind of ""edgy"" but it's all part of the fun.
November weddings are a mixed blessing. You get to experience NYC while the leaves are changing, but also when hotel rates start going through the roof. We decided to give this property a shot; given outrageous Manhattan pricing on Marathon weekend. So glad we did. The Opera House Hotel is a stunning and thoughtful example of how to start a neighborhood movement (gentrification). The level of service and quality of the room makes it a ""must"" for a 5-star experience at 3-star prices. Kudos to Myrna at the front desk who made us feel welcome and checked in each time we crossed her path to ensure all our needs were met. Sure, it's the Bronx and not Manhattan. Thus, the property is best suited to those who have business in this borough or just to sleep while getting UBER's back and forth to Manhattan for shows, dinners, and shopping. Truly above and beyond our expectations!
We were greeted by Kevin who was so helpful with all the hotel had to offer. Our room was perfect in every way. Beds so comfortable like sleeping on clouds. Wonderful breakfast, Hot drinks were Hot! The service was amazing. Amazing staff all around.  I can not wait to go back ! A perfect overnight!~
Needed five nights in NYC area for two couples and Manhattan is pretty expensive. Found the Opera House Hotel at a much more reasonable rate. While it isn't is in a very good neighborhood, this is a terrific hotel within 1 1/2 blocks of the two major subways into NYC and one of the best overall staffs we have ever experienced. From Emilio, the manager, to his team of Jonathan, Myrna, Jefferson, Kevin, Carlos and several others, these folks know how to make guests welcome. The rooms were top notch (the old Bronx Opera House was built in 1913, renovated four years ago and, if it had a pool and spa would be a four star rating or better). The continental breakfast was very good, the coffee machine was fabulous, etc., but mainly it was the staff! From initial phone calls through our entire stay, they greeted us by name, answered our questions or called to find out the answers, smiled constantly and really felt like friends. The neighborhood is old but, since the hotel went in, there is new development across the street (a Subway and Boston Market are immediately across the street) and it is a safe daytime and early evening walk to the subway station (we also found out that seniors can get half-price rides if you buy a round-trip card from the live ticket booth every time you need a ride).
Hello. My boyfriend and I just got back from 5 nights at the Opera House Hotel. I had read the reviews in advance of going and was a little reserved given some of the feedback in terms of the area etc. I cannot fault the hotel or the staff. The hotel was lovely and clean and the breakfast sets you up for the day The staff were always helpful and very friendly. Jefferson couldn't do enough to make sure we were happy and gave us tips on where to go and get around. The hotel is really handy for the subway and Dunkin Doughnuts if you want a coffee before you travel. If I was going to NY again I would happily stay at the Opera House Thank you for making our stay enjoyable. Catherine,/Hotel_Review-g47369-d4702280-Reviews-Opera_House_Hotel-Bronx_New_York.html

This was my first time staying at this hotel. It was great experience. From the staff to the front desk manager all gave me that welcoming feeling. I stay at here for Labor Day weekend.

The hotel is renovated, which is nice. The staff is great as well. They went above and beyond in the work that they did. The breakfast is good too, it is a grab and go style so don't expect a big selection.
The staff were very nice, helpful and accommodating. Our room was small but clean and comfortable. It was convenient to the subway, about a 10 minute walk and the neighborhood felt safe. Definitely a cheaper alternative to staying in Manhattan and you get the full NY experience with taking the subway, which was easy to figure out once you got the hang of it. 
I enjoyed my stay at this particular hotel. I have stayed here before on multiple locations. I will continue to stay at this hotel so long as the service remains the same. Also it located near public transportation.,/Hotel_Review-g60827-d1657771-Reviews-La_Quinta_Inn_Suites_Brooklyn_Downtown-Brooklyn_New_York.html
Come on people if you want the Waldorf go to the Waldorf! this is La Quinta in Brooklyn. I think you can tell by the price you aren't getting a five star palace in mid-town. What you are getting is quick friendly checkin service, restaurant recommendations, efficient checkout and a quick call for a cab. Up stairs you can expect a small but meticulously CLEAN room that looks as if it has been recently renovated. The bed was comfortable, the room quiet and dark. There was a TV and a kettle to make tea or coffee in the morning. The shower was excellent and the breakfast more than adequate. People what do you want for under 200 bucks in New York? I would say this was a great little hotel wrapped up in an incredible deal. Great choice if you are leaving on QM2 from it's pier in Red Hook.

The accommodations were clean and Staff readily available to help. Complimentary breakfast was good with a nice variety of food including individual omelets, hot oatmeal, fruit, toast, pastry, juice and coffee. We didn't get the wake-up call in time for the Marathon race but were able to get up in time. 
Paid for a room for my brother to stay. When he arrived they turned him away since he was not me, the cardholder and still charged my card and said it was a no show. 
First of all i would like to start with a positive the bed was very comfy and the room was nice and warm for October, but unfortunately that is were the positives stop! I understood that being in Brooklyn the hotel would be expensive and the rooms would be small, but that does not mean it needs to be out dated and un-kept! I did not mind the small rooms, nor did i mind the subway station right next door, which made the bathroom shake! as once im asleep i don't notice those things anyway. But i was also not expecting to be woken up at 4:30am, 5:30am AND 6:30am, with people moving furniture and talking right outside our door! The next morning we realised it was the STAFF!! as we were right next to their staff room. Had this been stated to us we would have asked to move higher up the building away from the noise, but...HOW CAN YOU HIRE STAFF THAT ARE SO INCONSIDERATE OF YOUR SLEEPING GUESTS!! Just Awful! will NEVER stay here again!
We chose this hotel for the price and location/proximity to Manhattan. The rooms were clean and adequate, the staff was always polite and eager to help. Beds were comfy, and breakfast had enough healthy options (in addition to donuts and muffins) to fortify us for a busy day.  Our room was by the train tracks, so if you're a light sleeper you might ask for a room on the other side.
Came a day early for the wedding of the daughter of friends, (Pasquale and Anna Polino). From check-in, to check-out we couldn’t have been more pleased. The room, cleanliness, and decor of the entire facility was superb. The food was outstanding. You have an excellent venue. We wouldn’t hesitate to return simply to get away, and “decompress”. Taking the extra day was a great decision. Thank you,  Richard-Alan Montemuro
Everything about the Fox Hollow was great. I loved my room, everyone was nice and the room that the wedding is was very pretty. I enjoyed the brunch on Sunday there were plenty of choices to eat and drink. 
Beautiful hotel! The hotel staff should take the glass off the tables in the room to clean both sides and under the glass. Overall great stay!  The fire alarm did go off, and it was blaring for 20 minutes in the morning which was very uncomfortable. 
This hotel was New York excellence at its best. The food was outstanding and portions were plentiful. The breakfast buffet was the best I've seen. The room was large, lovely and immaculate and the price was reasonable.
The Inn At Fox Hollow was the perfect location for our visit to St. John's Cemetery. The room was spacious and included all needed amenities. The complementary meals was dining at its best. We savored the food and lingered in the dining room. We spent time in front of the fireplaces enjoying the ambiance which came from watching families gather for weddings and other celebrations. It was a joyful venue. The location was ideal for travels to Sagamore Hill, St. John's Memorial Cemetery and Oyster Bay. I hope to return one day.
The hotel was great. The room was the perfect size and very comfortable. The hotel staff was very accommodating. The only low point is the food at the buffet breakfast. Could be better quality, but it wasn’t horrible
Beautiful room, and setting. Meals are good. Shuttle service information is very limited ... and inconvenient to reserve (I don't understand, for example, how shuttles can be ""booked"" for 7 - 10 am ... if that's possible, then the hotel really doesn't have an on-demand shuttle service for guests.)
Only 2 blocks from Flushing Main St Subway station on Line 7. Majority of shops in area are Chinese, also staff in Asiatic Hotel seem to be. Staff are efficient and friendly, and both hotel and room look recently built/refurbished, and as such is the cleanest, freshest, smartest accommodation we have stayed in in America. Our room on 7th floor had a great view of La Guardia approach, though didn't stop me from sleeping. We flew in/out of JFK and used Airtrain and subway to hotel, then Q44 bus (bus stop end of street) to Jamaica, then Q3 bus into JFK, thus avoiding $5-6 each Airtrain charge. In our room, we had kettle, but unlike other accommodation we have stayed in, had no coffee machine, microwave or fridge. Breakfast buffet had a larger than average choice, though this was because of the Chinese connection with oatmeal, rice porridge and dumplings.
Trying to keep costs down for our trip to New York we picked the Asiatic hotel, the hotel was perfectly clean , the staff very friendly it included breakfast although not a huge choice definitely sufficient to set you up for your day of sight seeing and the safe in the room was free , and with only a 5 minute walk to the tube station which takes you directly into Times Square was perfect lots of hustle and bustle outside during the day but a bit of a ghost town at night which is where we felt most vulnerable , but all in all a great stay 
Stayed here for the US Open. I cannot recommend this location more highly if you are in town for tennis or baseball. It is a 20 minute walk, or a couple of minutes on the subway, and the crowds are all going the other way! The rates are also a LOT better than you will get in Manhattan. That said, it is not Manhattan. Nightlife, food, culture, and entertainment are all NOT in Flushing. But, this hotel is friendly, priced right, clean, with decent sized rooms and a good price.
Close to La Guardia by Lyft under $20. Refundable $100 room hold. Trip Advisor rate firm. Desk knew terrific nearby dumpling restaurant, Nan Xiang, on Prince St. Room spa not working, toilet noisy after using. Figure fix is ongoing as is a refurbished bldg. Quiet, clean otherwise. Fine chinese american breakfast included pork, wheat, and red bean buns! Friendly.
Among the best -- if not THE best -- of the Asian hotels in the bustling Chinatown-and-then-some neighborhood at the terminus of the 7 subway line. The Asiatic offered a quiet, spotless room decorated as if you were in, well, Asia; comfortable bed; well-equipped bathroom with robust hot water and free toiletries; and warm hospitality. It is less than five minutes' walk from the 7 station and surrounded by more tempting Chinese, Vietnamese, etc. restaurants than you can possibly get to. This neighborhood, 30 or so minutes from Manhattan, is a smart budget alternative to staying in the epicenter of the city and the Asiatic will be the hotel I try first in future. 
I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights while commuting to Manhattan daily. Although the area is quite far from the city, it is very crowded during rush hour, and parking at a nearby garage is expensive (20$-30$/day). The hotel itself was clean and quite. The staff was courteous, and the breakfast was standard for a 2-star hotel. If the location is fine with you, I would definitely recommend Asiatic. Tip: If you need an iron, you will have to request on from the front desk.
Spent 5 nights here to attend family function, chose this hotel due to good rating and cheaper price. This hotel is located in Chinatown, Flushing with walking distance to the subway station and it’s very close to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre. The rooms were clean, modern and had flat screen TV, slippers, some toiletries and kettle. Price included breakfast and the food was all that you need in the morning, there were many restaurants around our hotel and a Starbucks just few minutes away. There is no parking at the hotel however there is one down the street and its $20 per day without in and out privilege. Will definitely recommend this hotel.
We held a work event at the Wythe, in fact we’ve held several there, and it was perfect for the size of meeting we had. The hotel is very hip with its brick walls, large windows and great views of NYC. The food is very good and has a nice bar too. It’s not cheap, and as expensive of NYC hotels, but if you can afford to stay there it is a treat.
Had a great time in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The Wythe hotel is within minutes of interesting vintage stores and busy bars and restaurants. The Wythe is built in what used to be an arms factory during the war and they’ve preserved most of the iron and wooden beams, as well as the red stone walls inside the buildings and rooms. The rooms are very comfortable, simply furnished, but enough to make your stay relaxing. The mini bar offers choices of alcoholic beverages and soft drinks and most of all... finally...a large bathroom in a New York boutique hotel, something not very frequent in top rated hotels. The staff is very welcoming and always shows a sincere smile, making you feel like one of their preferred guests. The hotel’s Reynard Restaurant could offer a bit more on their menu, especially for breakfast, but the few things offered are quality guaranteed and delicious. The roof top bar and terrace offer a startling view of the Manhattan’s east side, overlooking the Hudson waterfront.
The hotel is located in an old factory in the middle of the trendy area of Williamsburg, next to some clubs. The place looks amazing, rooms are very well designed and the views on Manhattan are just amazing. Nevertheless, the service was very standard for a hotel like this (for example, no comments at all at the reception when we checked-out, after a Sunday morning without hot water).
My cousin got married at the Wythe in June and our stay there was a delight from start to finish! First of all, it would never have occurred to us to stay in Brooklyn rather than in the city, but we fell in love with the neighborhood and we absolutely preferred staying here to staying downtown. The room was a Brooklyn Queen and it was decorated in a spare style we enjoyed very much. The mini bar was like no mini bar we had even encountered. Bottles of Barr Hill Gin and other delights were lovely to have at our fingertips. The bathroom was just gorgeous and the very large windows and exposed brick made for a beautiful place to stay.  We ate at the Reynard for lunch one day and that was delicious. We dined and drank at the rooftop bar. That was beautiful and what a view! The food at the wedding held at the hotel was outstanding, too, but somehow, we managed to fit even more food into our bellies as we cruised around Williamsburg. Maison Premiere was enchanting. We happened upon Smorgasburg, which was incredible! We ate a charming brunch at the Rabbit Hole. We would absolutely stay at the Wythe again.
Visited the rooftop bar with a couple of friends. The view of Manhattan was to die for. We were there during sunset which made it even more amazing. Prices were fair and the service was good! I would definately recommend people visiting this place!,/Hotel_Review-g60827-d2556148-Reviews-Wythe_Hotel-Brooklyn_New_York.html
We were greeted at the door by friendly people. The security is wonderful. The desk person was friendly and helpful . The room was industrial ,clean ,comfortable and had a wet bar,large shower,and great view of Brooklyn Bowl.The restaurant is open wiht drinks and food . Bar on the 6th floor with a view . Walking distance to subway,lots of restaurants,and shops.
Visited the roof top bar with a friend on a flying visit to NYC. Views are stunning on a clear night over to Manhattan. Good atmosphere with an interesting and varied crowd on the terrace. Expensive drinks but you are paying for the views although the Manhattan cocktails were great!,/Hotel_Review-g60827-d2556148-Reviews-Wythe_Hotel-Brooklyn_New_York.html
Stayed for 7 nights. The hotel itself is old but its well taken care of. The parking is small but its free and in NYC its a blessing to even have parking. Just know that if theres an event in the hotel, theres a chance you may not find parking for a little while. The breakfast is great. Eggs, sausage, potatoes (a little dry but ok), toast, bagels, yougurts, fruits, waffles (will all the toppings avail), coffee machine w/ hot chocolate options, french vanilla, hazelnut creamers and even whipped cream (at waffle station). I was able to make my own cappuchinos every morning. I'd stay there again w/o a question.
This hotel happens to be a very nice place to stay the breakfast is to die for the rooms are very clean close to Bell Blvd which is very lively place for the younger crowd 21 n over bus stops right in front of hotel if you don't have a car n right off the cross island parkway,/Hotel_Review-g47289-d99254-Reviews-Best_Western_Queens_Gold_Coast-Bayside_Queens_New_York.html
The location was perfect as I had to travel to attend a family matter in NY. My stay was short but I was pleased with the room and staff. I will recommended to my family and friends, the price was reasonable, the room was clean and the hotel offered breakfast.
The staff was excellent. Could not close bathroom door, felt like you were in a box if you did. The roller bed mattress, was nothing but springs. Hallway & elevator gloomy Looked gloomy and dirty. Parking was terrible.
Easy access to and from the hotel from Cross Island Pkwy. Very clean and comfortable room, nice breakfast, pleasant staff, onsite free parking, and affordable price. Great location wherever your destination is throughout NYC.. I would stay at this location whether traveling for business or pleasure because of my prior statements. Further, there are many restaurants and shopping opportunities in the vicinity.
We were in the area for a wedding and they had a block of rooms at this hotel. Booking was a little difficult as they couldn't find the block of rooms, but the manager upgraded my room because of the trouble we had. The staff is helpful and the breakfast was good. The rooms are small but comfortable. Very small bathrooms.
I stayed at the Comfort Inn because I was looking for a reasonably priced hotel in New York on Marathon Weekend. When I arrived, I found that 83rd Street, where the hotel is located, turns into a one-way street going AWAY from the hotel just before it reaches the front entrance. After a couple of trips around the block didn't yield an entrance to the street going the right way, I eventually got there by ignoring the one-way signs and turning into the hotel's off-street parking lot.  Check-in was quick and easy; my room was clean and bright and the bed was beyond comfortable. Surprisingly, although the landing pattern for LaGuardia Airport is DIRECTLY AND IMMEDIATELY over the hotel, the jet noise was effectively blocked and I was not awakened overnight.  There was a nice hot breakfast in the morning along with in-room coffee. The room TV was connected to Direct-TV. There is a free shuttle bus to the airport, although I didn't need it.  Checkout was even easier than check-in. I got my car from the lot and, this time driving the right way, figured out how to get toto the Grand Central Parkway and home. I recommend this hotel for airline passengers; it's clean, comfortable and friendly. It's probably not a good choice for people whose primary purpose is going to Manhattan; the nearest public transportation is the Q47 bus, which (eventually) connects to the subway. But I would happily stay there again if the need arose.
Very nice, convenient to LaGuardia. Reasonanly priced. Very clean & comfortable; decent breakfast. Front desk staff was awesome! Free 5 minute shuttle to airport, which is unusual in NY! Will definitely stay here again! 
We flew to LaGuardia to get on a ship and stayed over night at the Comfort Inn LaGuardia. The best price in town. We were expecting poor quality for the price, but we were pleasantly surprised when we walked in and saw how clean it was. Great service and comfortable room.
Very close to airport.quaint hotel with excellent staff. Good value. Rooms small but so are most others. Good breakfast. Elevator togetr you and your bags there.  Would stay again ate down the street at Dalton's. Great food and so safe walking distance,/Hotel_Review-g47626-d1485917-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_LaGuardia_Airport_83rd_St-East_Elmhurst_Queens_New_York.html
Very convenient at 5min car from laguardia airport. There is a shuttle from 4am. The hotel is basic and ok for short stay before flying. Wifi is free and works well. Rooms are ok with the basics. Some rooms are on a -1 floor.,/Hotel_Review-g47626-d1485917-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_LaGuardia_Airport_83rd_St-East_Elmhurst_Queens_New_York.html
This hotel is an ideal place to stay at. The room is large and clean. The bed was fantastic and so cumpy I didn't want to get up in the mornings. The staff friendly and very helpful with a good shuttle service to and from airport plus the tennis. I would certainly stay again.,/Hotel_Review-g47626-d1485917-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_LaGuardia_Airport_83rd_St-East_Elmhurst_Queens_New_York.html
This hotel was great value for the cost paid. The hotel was located a short walk (15 min) walk to a subway station. It looked great from the outside and our room was very comfortable and roomy. They also had a very nice breakfast with hot items as well as the usual cereal and toast options. We really enjoyed our stay.,/Hotel_Review-g60827-d636123-Reviews-Best_Western_Plus_Brooklyn_Bay_Hotel-Brooklyn_New_York.html
Came in recently for a trip. The room was decent (luckily I didn't get a basement room), there were some upgrades that were done, but you can tell they still need some work. In my case, the bathroom needs a new paint job, the door and wall paint is peeling and chipped. Shower water pressure is fairly weak and water isn't hot enough. If you are visiting during cooler seasons, the hotel is pretty cold in the common areas including the lobby. Be aware, there is a lot of road nice that you hear. Breakfast is also included which is nice, but nothing special - your typical free breakfast staple items. 
Rooms are small but decor is very nice, walk in shower also. Breakfast food, eggs, bacon, sausage, a no for me. Eggs cold bacon and sausage tasteless. Dining area nice with a booth. Front desk was a little slow with checkout and there was only one couple in front of us. Pleasant though. My biggest complaint security for that back exit door especially when people are sleeping right in front of it. Also door leading to parking lot was cracked and taped up. Until these security issues are addressed, I would not go back or recommend the hotel to anyone.
Hotel was clean, Breakfast was better then most. The noice level from street traffic really bad. Need double paned windows. Also on the 4th of November at 2or3am 3 or 4 young men were on the corner , yelling at cars, kicking bus sign , climbing the bus sign . I was very afraid . They could have come into hotel lobby at any time. Hotel has no security. Nor did hotel staff call police . Also glass door to parking lot cracked and just taped together. Why not repaired,
This hotel was very cozy and all the amenities were good. Good value for your money. I would recommend this hotel to anyone in the New York area and seeking somewhere central to stay. Staff were great and the rooms were quite comfortable.,/Hotel_Review-g60827-d636123-Reviews-Best_Western_Plus_Brooklyn_Bay_Hotel-Brooklyn_New_York.html
This Hotel could use some updating. Room and bathroom size were ok. Chair was missing from the room, never replaced even when commented to front desk. No place to sit but on the bed. Parking is definitely at your own risk! Two extremely small lots. One with worn plywood over a huge drop off, the only way in or out of the upper lot. The lower lot was almost impossible to get out of because it is so small. The breakfast was always late in setting up, no variety, everything is microwaved while you wait to eat. The staff at breakfast was nice and tried to be helpful. Front desk staff seems unknowledgeable, not very helpful. The location is good for restaurants, public transportation and Coney Island. Don't think we would return to this Hotel.
