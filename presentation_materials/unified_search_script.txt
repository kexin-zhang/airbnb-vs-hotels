Script:

In order for the user to be able to easily find and compare Airbnbs and Hotels, we created a unified search based on location that returns the nearest of both listings.

We used ElasticSearch as our database and search engine to handle the search queries.

We take in input string and convert it to a latitude and longitude pair using the OpenStreetMap API.

We then run a search query across both the Airbnb and Hotel indices to return the nearest matching listings.

Bullets:
- Used ElasticSearch as a database and search backend.
- Converted search string to a latitude/longitude pair using OpenStreetMap API.
- Fed this pair into an ElasticSearch location query which returns a unified list of nearest Airbnb and hotels.
