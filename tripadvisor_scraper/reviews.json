Have stayed there previously (some 10 years ago) and not much seems to have changed in that time (other than some of the really nice staff have been replaced by staff that border on being rude and are less then helpful) Had difficulty in getting any hot water for the first few days - lukewarm was about the best we could get. Complained daily but it wasn't til the last few days that we consistently got hot water. The hotel offers wifi - we and everyone else we spoke with were not able to get the wifi to work properly. Were able to log on but that was about as far as you were able to go. Again, we complained daily and were told that we must be doing something wrong or that our electronic devices were the problem. Staff would score 10/10 for total indifference. Look - the location of the hotel is superb, right by Columbus Circle, but that is about the only thing it has going for it. The bathroom in the room in which we stayed was not clean - superficially perhaps but there was mold in the grouting and the bathtub was really dangerous. When showering the bottom of the tub was extremely slippery, there was no rubber mat in the bath and no hand rails for safety. We realize that this hotel is less expensive than others in the immediate area but at over $300 per night we expected a better standard than that which we received.", "review_date": "November 3, 2017"},

The breakfast is a continental one with muffins, rolls, coffee and tea, but there are no tables, so it is a bit odd to eat there. If you are looking for a hotel with free coffee 24/7, or an exercise room, etc, this may not be the hotel for you. It is a very basic, just sleep there and get up and go type of hotel.

After we dropped off the suitcase, we needed to use a restroom. The desk clerk said the only one was in the basement. She would contact the staff to call for the elevator to go down there. We went to the elevator and waited. We went back to the desk clerk to tell her we were still waiting. She apologize and called the staff. The room is very small. You have to place your clothes in the dresser, because there is not a place to open your suitcase except on the bed.  There was only one washcloth for two people. The refrigerator is old and weak. The bar to hold the water bottle in the refrigerator door in place is missing. Which makes even less room in the refrigerator. We wanted to freshen up between a day of sightseeing and the Broadway Play we were going to see, but couldn't because there was no hot water. I would have been nice if that was communicated to us ahead of time. When we mentioned it to the desk clerk, she said it going through some maintenance and was only down for only 10 minutes.

Just as with other hotels, a credit card for incidentals is required at check-in. I was shocked to discover, however, that a $45 charge was added AFTER I checked out. I contacted the hotel and they said the added charge was due to my checking out minutes after check out time. I explained that I was completely packed, the door was wide open, and no one came even to the floor, nevermind my room, nor did anyone call. (Other rooms were vacant and no one was waiting in the lobby for a room to vacate.) The hall is short and the floors are not carpeted--I could hear if the elevator came or if someone walked in the hall, yet no maid, no hotel staff, no one ever came to my floor. I received no warning whatsoever, so I thought it would be no problem if I took a few minutes to map my route to my next destination on my computer. Had I known I might be charged an additional 50% of the $90 room rate, I would have left immediately. The hotel mgr refused to refund the $45 charge, insisting that it was due to my minutes of overstaying in my room and that it was not the hotel's duty to warn guests--the way they do at every other hotel in every state and country to which I've traveled. In the circumstances, the charge was grossly unfair. If no standard grace period is allowed, the hotel should notify guests upon check-in of the potential to incur additional charges if they stay in the room mere minutes beyond check out time.", "review_date": "April 26, 2017"},

Please read to the end as I am not by nature a moaner. This is my first negative review of many as I am always objective. It may sound like a bad one off experience but I do fear the hotel is on its way out. When we checked in there was a sign indicating that there was a problem and that there was no hot water. We were assured this was temporary and that the problem would be sorted. That night the noise was horrendous. The heating pipe running through the room was banging as if someone in the room above was hitting it with a hammer. Halfway through the first night a piece of plaster came away from the ceiling around this pipe possible due to the vibrations. We did raise this in the morning and were dismissed with a 'all the rooms are the same ' comment. Each night we experienced the same sleepless experience with loud banging and clanging. On the last morning we woke to find out that there was no hot water. I contacted the receptionist who did try another room and soon established that this was another problem with the water. Cutting a long story short we had to go out without having a hot wash. We returned several times during the day to find out that there was still no water. The owner was now ignoring the receptionists calls and had quickly disappeared when the complaints came in refusing to speak to us. Back in the UK I emailed the hotel and I'm yet to get a response (1 month later). I contacted the company who I booked through who to their credit were very good who also failed to get a response. Subsequently they have phone to this company and accepted the problems but refused any form of compensation. Now I accept things can go wrong but when you're paying for a service a lot relies upon the service you get when there is a problem.

We loved it! After a long red eye flight we were able to check in 3 hours early and were so thrilled. Because of our long stay we were given a wonderful room, number 502 on the top floor facing a beautiful view of the street and some lovely buildings. I will try to include some photos of our room, and you will see that the room looks exactly like the photos the hotel uses in their advertisements. We were certainly not disappointed in any way. The room had all of the amenities advertised and we had NO problems that others have mentioned such as insects, issues with air conditioning, lack of hot water, uncomfortable beds etc. For us everything was perfect. The rooms were excellently cleaned and the housekeeping staff very accommodating to our schedule. Anna at the front desk was also very helpful, friendly and lovely and on our day of departure gave us great advice about getting to the airport and then arranged for us an airport shuttle which turned out to be a great option. As others have mentioned the location near Columbus Circle was terrific and it was so easy to get around anywhere we wanted on the subway from there. We always felt safe at night around the hotel and even on the subway. The restaurant below the hotel was delicious and we got a 15% discount for being a guest at the hotel. My only recommendation for the hotel would be to provide at least one microwave oven in the lobby area where the coffee pot is located. After eating huge meals in restaurants I often brought back leftovers and put them in our room refrigerator, however there was no way to reheat them to enjoy later. Anna was willing to microwave them in the restaurant for us but each time we asked for this service the restaurant happened to be closed. It would have been wonderful to have the option to have a centrally located microwave. Another suggestion would be to have a Keurig machine in the lobby area for guests to use. Often by the time we wanted coffee the breakfast service had been cleaned up and there was no coffee available. We had to go to the McDonald's next door which was always packed with people. Having a Keurig machine would have been a wonderful perk for guests. These two ideas would make up for the lack of coffee pots and microwaves in the rooms. As others have said the hotel seems very European and quaint. The price was certainly reasonable! We would be thrilled to return there should we ever be fortunate enough to return to New York City.

It's tucked away on a relatively quiet street (by Manhattan standards) and it's a small, understated place between a couple of smaller restaurants (the Italian one is really good!). The lobby is quaint and inviting while the front desk team is friendly and efficient. They serve free coffee and bagels in the morning from the lobby. The rooms are clean and functional but lack charm. Furniture is kind of creaky and could use upgrades. Room sizes vary greatly so ask about square footage if that matters to you. We were given a room facing the street and it was a large rectangular space. I noticed the rooms down the hallway facing the alleys were smaller. The hallways are narrow and the elevator small.  In sum, Da Vinci is a basic hotel with good staff in a solid location where rooms are less expensive than surrounding more modern hotels. If they would upgrade room furnishings it would put them up to the next level. Still, it's a decent bordering on good choice if you're going to Manhattan during peak times when hotel rooms are very expensive.", "review_date": "July 4, 2016"},

One woman staff member at the desk provided me numerous options for breakfast / brunch in the area. There are several nearby restaurants from which to choose, another plus. I chose to eat at Bread and Honey (across the street!) which was perfect. You can also find a McDonald's and a Wendy's nearby if you wish something along those lines. Another plus is that this hotel is an easy walk from Port Authority. Follow Eighth Avenue from 42nd to 56th, and you will find the Da Vinci Hotel right there. The staff was willing to keep my (small) luggage at the desk after I checked out, while I spent some time exploring the city.

Used Trip Advisor and other sources to find it and booked it thru Expedia. Arrived early on Saturday morning after getting off the boat. Rooms were not ready as would be expected but understood we could leave our bags until check-in. This is a small hotel and does not have a secure bag storage area. Instead, bags are left around the walls of the lobby and smaller items can be placed behind the desk. So if you are worried about leaving your bags, this is not the place for you. When we came back at 3:00, our rooms were ready and our bags were still there. Rooms are small and not comfortable for spending any time. The classic chairs are not made for sitting in for any length of time. The bed, while soft, was comfortable and we slept well every night. The bathroom was large compared to our cruise ship and the water very HOT. Be careful as it is hot enough to burn. Our major source of discomfort was the AC. No way to control ours. It was either on and cooled the room so cold we couldn't stand it or it was off and we were too hot. No fan control or lower setting. So it was on and off every time we were in the room.The location was ideal. 3 blocks to Central Park and 11 short blocks to the Theater district with hundreds of restaurants within walking distance. Located between 7th Ave and 8th Ave on 56th St, The blocks are short going from 56th up or down and long blocks going between the avenues. We walked an average 6-8 miles a day to combat the eating opportunities that surrounded us. The hotel offers coffee and muffins from 7:00 to 10:00 every morning, but some mornings the coffee was not ready by 7:00. The lobby is not someplace you would want to spend time as it has two of the same uncomfortable chairs as your room and some benches. They do offer free wifi and it worked well. There were also two PC's in the lobby for use and a printer to print out boarding passes. All the staff we met seemed friendly and trying to do a good job.

I read the reviews before booking, and the reviews seems to be accurate. I stayed on the 5th floor, the first room off the elevator. Air conditioning unit worked fine - it did run all the time, but that was just \"white noise\" to me, and I'm a sound sleeper anyways. The room was plain, had a refrigerator and desk, a couple of chairs. Double bed, but with room on both sides to get in and out. Could use a little improving - the door on the cabinet which housed the frig was broken, the hand rail on the shower door was broken off and leaning on the wall under the sink. Bathroom door hinges rusting from underneath the layers of paint. Bathtub was very slippery - had to be very careful during shower. The shower water kind of dribbled at times, like at home when someone flushes the toilet, but I just stayed until there was flow again, a few seconds later. But bed was wonderful, nice and firm. The pillows unfortunately were also quite firm, rather old. \"Breakfast\" was coffee, tea, rolls, croissants, jelly, butter, with paper plates, with ottomans only for sitting to eat. Based on the comments I read before going, I took some instant oatmeal and was fine with that. But lots of restaurants near by - I walked a few blocks to Europa Cafe and enjoyed a nice diner breakfast there with good prices. Ate dinner at the Indian Restaurant next door, and loved the vegan choices we ordered. The desk staff was friendly and helpful, especially as I had problems with the computer and printer, to print off my boarding pass. The lobby is small, but pleasant, lots of warm wood. Not many rooms in the hotel, so I didn't see that many people, and it was quiet. Ice bucket is filled in the restaurant in the basement - going there directly, or by asking the desk staff. I didn't eat in the restaurant, but it looked to be cozy. I agree with other reviewers, that it's a good price for the location - a few blocks from Columbus Circle and the wonderful Central Park, and to Times Square in the other direction, Broadway, Carnegie Hall, 5th Ave., etc. etc. I would stay again for the convenient location for the not expensive price.", "review_date": "August 3, 2015"},

A random, extra chair lingered in the room for no reason. The bathroom was poorly lit and the 2 bath towels that hung on the towel rack had seen better days; like in 1979. The shower was was ice-cold and when I called the front desk, the very nice woman informed me that the water source was all on one line and therefore could not be cold. She did not offer me another room but asked if she could send someone up to \"look\" at the water. Needing to hurry to my event I showered and shivered. In the morning, the water was lukewarm, the air conditioner still pumped out un-conditioned air and the random chair was standing proudly at the end of my bed. As I scanned the room for one last look before checking out, I noticed that there were no tissues, no trash can (accept for what was in the bathroom), no dresser, bad hangers in a little box that you could hang 5 things and 3 rolls of unwrapped, half used toilet paper that were lined up on the shelf under the mirror.

The room was OK, and fairly pleasant. We stayed in room 102 which is on the ground floor. The one window overlooked an alleyway. The room had air conditioning which was very effective, and there was also a fridge. A very comfortable double bed, and a great wall mounted TV with hundreds of TV channels. There was a safe in the room which was free to use. For some strange reason, during the daytime there was a loud banging sound like something bit hit with a hammer in the alleyway. It was not a person making the noise, but some sort of mechanical issue. I didn't raise this with the staff and it didn't cause any issue as it was just in the day. Anyone complaining about the breakfast I think are pretty ungrateful and a little mis-guided. No hotels in NY offer breakfast (well mostly anyway). It was a complimentary breakfast comprising of coffee, croissants and muffins. There wasn't any juice or much choice but it was complimentary and something we didn't expect as we had a \"ROOM ONLY\" booking. We had coffee and croissant before going out to have a proper breakfast somewhere else. Location is good. About 3 blocks from subway, 10 blocks from Times Square which takes about 15-20 minutes to walk. There is a McDonalds next door to the hotel, a Wendys, a starbucks almost oppositte, a Chipotle, lots of diners, and bars, a hooters on the same road. Basically, you are in a great spot. Also 3 blocks away is Central Park. Bathroom was very clean and so too was the room. It wasn't huge, but there was more than enough room for us.

The Italian restaurant below the hotel (where you get a discount) and the Fuji Sushi next door but one, are two I dined at a couple of times. Both very good and reasonably priced. The Da Vinci itself, which I booked via Booking.com,is very well priced. The staff are very friendly and go out of their way to help. The hotel is small, but this is what gives it its character. There is free wifi in the rooms and two computers downstairs in the lobby, which are for guests' use. In the rooms there is a small safe, a fridge and an ironing board. They could do with a bit more hanging space for clothes, but there are two drawers as well. Actually if they took the safe out of the wardrobe it would help.

Our first visit to NYC. Firstly, fantastic location, minutes from Central Park, Times Square, Rockerfeller Centre etc, however the rooms need a refurb (and we were told we had an upgrade). Size wise it was fine as we were out all day exploring the city so just a base to sleep in really, however the decor and furniture was old and depressing. Our room in general had a faint oldy scent to it so did the bedding so not great, however it appeared clean. Apart from crashing out initially due to tiredness after a few hours I awoke aching due to the very soft bed (too soft - think rolling into each other and you'll get it) and also due to constantly droning extraction units in the area right outside the window. Bathroom was fine other than a temperamental shower, no biggie though. Staff were friendly enough from the brief contacts we had with them. We grabbed a coffee and a slice of cake on the way out every morning which was a decent start to a days sight seeing (there were pastries and donuts and other drinks too). There's a Lenny's diner amongst others just round the corner if you want a more substantial breakfast too. Wifi worked faultlessly in our room. Rooms were serviced daily, they do come late in the day as other reviews have stated but no problems there. Over all if you just need a place to crash out then it does it's job, me personally if I came to NYC again I'd pay a little more and stay somewhere else, just personal preference though. We had a great time in NY and the hotel didn't spoil it by any means, it could just be so much nicer with a bit of effort (they could even charge more then too, the location was that good that I'd even pay more to stay there again if it was refurbed/restyled).", "review_date": "January 10, 2014"},

Probably not unless we hear their beds are better. But if you enjoy sleeping on extra firm beds, then this would be a good place for you to be based in midtown.

No issues with pressure or water temp. The bed was very comfortable and I slept extremely well each night after long, busy days of sight seeing. As well, my room was very quiet.   The in room wi-fi access could be spotty depending on the time of day, but it served my needs just fine when checking email and planning my days. TV stations were limited, but who's in NYC to watch TV anyway. There was a nice offering of coffee and rolls in the lobby each morning. I wouldn't call it a continental breakfast but It was good enough to start the day with. My only wish for this area would have been a coffee maker in the room. Joe G's restaurant is located in the basement and is open for lunch and dinner. It wasn't great, but it was pretty good and they did offer a 15% discount to hotel guests. Do note, as well, that there is an unlimited choice of dining options within a quick walk form this hotel. The staff was by no means doting, however, when I needed advice or assistance they were more than willing to help. With their help and directions I was easily able to take the subway to JFK for my departure flight. That was a huge savings compared to a Taxi or shuttle service. I like this place a lot and I highly recommend it.", "review_date": "March 31, 2013"},

Subway access to almost all lines is very close. It has an italian restuarant in the basement (didn't try it), but is also surrounded by food establishments (Lenny's - around the corner on 8th is excellent for breakfast and a cuban restaurant - Guantanamera - is great for dinner). The rooms are typically small as in most older New York hotels, but are very clan and comforable. Now for the \"Except...\" The shower. The first day we had to let the water run for about 20-25 minutes to get anything more than lukewarm water (once it gets hot it is very hot). After that day, it was somewhat of a crapshoot. The water tempurature varied erratically - sometimes within just a couple of minutes. It never went straight cold, but just varied between lukewarm and too hot.

Right near subways so easy to get around, a 2 minute walk to central park, and walkable also to time square. Great location. On arrival from the airport we bought a week subway pass for $29 which was a bargain. Easy to get from the airport to Manhattan/hotel. On arrival we had a slight wait as they was talking to guests who was there first but seemed to take ages. Room was bigger than we thought which was a bonus. Safe in the room free of charge and a fridge. No additional room charges. Wifi worked fine. There was some mould on the ceiling of our bathroom and the bath was discusting see picture - im a bath person but i didnt use it. The cleaners do clean your room late the higher up you are. we arrived at 4/5 to our room and it still wasnt cleaned - they knocked and we had to wait downstairs while they cleaned it.  breakfast- now it was a bonus to have the food but its basic, muffins, bread rolls and crossants if your lucky/early enough. On xmas day and new years though there was literally just muffins - i was disappointed the hotel didnt do anything special or maintained the normal quality and variety of food but was just muffins. Only coffee or tea so no squash etc..  Hotel is close to several supermarkets which is good to stock up on drink for your room and a shopping mall is near central park also.  checking out was easy as we pre-paid - they knew this so was quick and easy one problem we did have was our room cards stopped working and had to get reception to re-activate them. they said was because their nezr credit cards but mine wasnt so... ? who knows but was annoying when your freezing and want to get in the room.  you can hear lots of noise from the outside but thats new york for you - cars seem to honk for no reason and you can hear them even 5 floors up. Be warned but i still managed to sleep.  Heating fluctuated but it does work. The TV had poor channel choice and ours had a line going right through it so was faulty. Water was hard to get warm - i had to get the husband to do it on several occasions - if i had a shower the husband then had a cold shower - it wasnt the best. The layout of the room was poor - big table infront of the fridge/droors so really hard to get in and out of the fridge.

Location: Couldn't have asked for better. A block or two away from Central Park, 7ish minute walk from Times Square, loads of subway stations < 5 minute walk. SO many coffee/cafe shops and restaurants, plus a 24 hour McDonald's right next door. Wasn't too far from JFK airport either (I got the subway/air train and only took me 45ish minutes altogether).  Staff: Friendly and helpful. Didn't actually need them for anything other than checking in and out but I saw them helping other people out several times. Housekeeping: Friendly and flexible. There were several days when I was still in my room when they arrived (first few days it was 10am and then after that around 4:30pm for whatever reason) and the woman always said it wasn't a problem and she'd come back later (which she did). I also declined them on the first day (so jet-lagged) and she still gave me extra towels just in case. Room: Fine overall. I didn't think my room was /that/ small to be fair. It was a decent size for myself on my own anyway and I had room to move around (especially with a giant suitcase).  TV worked fine, got full (free) wifi signal (such a bonus), phone worked (although I didn't try ringing anybody). Wardrobe was a tiny bit small for hanging long things like dresses but you got two drawers so I did have enough space. I didn't have a view of anything (the window was frosted glass) but I looked out of the stairwell window next-door to me and had the view of a brick wall and could just see the Hearst Building. I didn't come for the hotel views though.  The shower was fine but slightly temperamental about what temperature it wanted to be. I spent a good 5 minutes trying to get it off freezing cold and then boiling hot (but it was fine once I'd adjusted it) one day and then another day it went from hot to warm and back again several times. Other than that it was okay. I have to admit that the bed was my worst nightmare. Don't get me wrong, it was clean, extremely comfy, and I'm sure it was bigger than a Queen size bed but the mattress is the softest thing ever. I have a bad back so sleeping on it was really bad some nights (especially if your muscles are already killing from walking around all day). I had to get up in the night at one point and lie on the hard floor for an hour because it was hurting. I did slightly adjust to it at the end of my week but it still hurt. I loved lying in it to watch TV and stuff because it was so comfy but not for sleeping I'm afraid. Some cons:  The air-con (which I didn't actually have on) was noisy at some points, especially in the early hours of the morning when it would come back on (even though it was off?) and make a bit of a noise. It was also quite noisy in the evening.  The smoke detector has two red blinking lights on it which blink every 5 seconds or so. Didn't notice it in the day but at night it drove me crazy! I hate things like that (I don't know why) and I bet nobody else had noticed it but I had to block it out by having the duvet over my head (which I do anyway so wasn't really an inconvenience) Finally, I did experience noise during the last few nights of my stay. I was on the third floor right by the stairwell (which is right over reception). I'm not sure if people had just arrived or were just getting in but there was REALLY loud door banging (made my room shake) at 3am on one night which happened several times during that night. Another night there was also loud talking below me and again door banging (just not as bad). Couldn't tell if it was from above or below. There was also a pigeon which had made it's home outside of my window so for about 4 mornings at 8am I was woken up by it cooing, flapping it's wings around, and banging (lightly) on the window. It was actually quite amusing. I was woken up by loads of fire engines going past one morning (other than that you couldn't hear the traffic apart from a few police cars and cars beeping every now and then) but I found out on the news that evening there had been a really bad fire a few blocks away so I'll let them off.

Having been myself I remembered what to expect from 'cheaper' New York hotels. Booked through Lastminute.com, checked hotel reviews on Trip Advisor all seemed good. When arriving at the hotel it seemed a bit longer than a 15 minute walk to Times Square, but once getting our bearings though (by always turning right out of the hotel), past Hooters we were at Times Square, 7 minute walk MAX!! Perfect..!! Back to the hotel, when we reached the hotel it looks very small, but don't be put off, very friendly hotel staff and quaint reception. Boutique style hotel, which was nice. Once we got to our room I felt a little upset by our room, but once settled, unpacked bags etc. I realised actually this hotel was fantastic. Clean? Extremely! Hot water? Yup! Hangers (don't want to waste baggage allowance)? Yup! TV (to keep up to date with news etc.)? Yup! Everything else, including a comfortable bed was a bonus! Chuffed... When booking the hotel we knew 80% of 'cheaper' hotels in NYC never include breakfast, much to our surprise the hotel included coffee/tea and light refreshments (muffins, bread rolls, croissants etc.) between 7am and 10am as part of your stay. Perfect again, grab a coffee and a bite to eat and we were off every morning! Being a boutique hotel means hardly any of the rooms had a view from the windows. The side rooms (like ours) had a window with a view of the building beside us - but hey we weren't there to look at views through our hotel window!! Hotel's location was great, as said above 7min walk to Times Square. Straight down 56th to Fifth Avenue or to Bloomingdales probably roughly about 20 minutes. Walk to Macys 10-15mins. Central park (already on top of it) about 10 minute walk too. Lots of coffee shops around us (but what street corner in NYC doesn't have a coffee shop?!). Next to the hotel was a small restaurant where we found out a lot of celebrities visit - lovely food too!! My summary to anyone looking at this hotel would be, if you want a base location, close to everything but not on the doorstep of the flashing lights of Times Square, with hot water which is kept to a clean standard then this hotel is perfect..!!

The only marking is a small oval with its name below the Joe G's restaurant sign. The restaurant is below the hotel and they are affiliated.  First, this is a good basic hotel. The rooms are not large. I would guess at around 200 sq. ft. As long as you don't plan on spending a lot of time in the room (TV reception was poor and choices were very limited), it will work. The rooms are clean and the bathrooms appear to have been renovated (new sink, toilet, tiles). The queen beds are fairly comfortable but the pillows can be a bit hard. Be advised that they do not make up the rooms until late in the afternoon, which we found out after returning at 4:00 PM and the room was not made up. Since we had not made a mess, we put out the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign and they slipped a note under the door stating that they did not make the room because of the sign. As we left the second day, we told the desk to have out room cleaned early and they did. The rooms have a queen sized bed, a bedside table on either side, a narrow desk, two chairs (our friends only had one), and an armoire, which housed an area for hanging clothes with a lockbox in it, two drawers, and a fridge (which, in our room, did not work). The hanger area in the armoire was barely tall enough to hang a man's shirt in the area to the side of the lockbox, but was generally too short to allow for clothing to hang properly. Each bedside table contained two large drawers. We had a different problem from an earlier review in that we had too much heat. There is no thermostat and the room heat is provided by a radiator, which was impossible to regulate. We could control the room temp somewhat by running the AC. The location was good for access to Central Park, Carnegie Hall, and locations in Midtown North. It was a bit of a walk to the Times Square area (i.e. 56th to 42nd streets) but, in general, it was well located. Bottom line, our friends and we would stay again, if the price was right.

For what I wanted to spend, I was either looking at something a little better then a Hostel, then the prices seemed to jump dramatically to Hotel prices. I some how stubbled across this place and read many of the reviews. After staying there, I understand what the negatives are saying, but I also wonder what they were expected!!! This hotel does not have a massive star rating, but that should not affect your decision.  New York Hotel rooms are going to be small, end of story! For what you pay here, the rooms are a decent size! What do you need the extra space for anyway? The hotel was a place to sleep and shower, thats pretty much it. The desk is attended 24/7, and the staff were lovely! I asked them for directions/advice a couple of times, and they were more then friendly!!! FYI, you pay for the hotel on arrive. I knew this, and it was no big deal. Wifi is included. Breakfast is available from 7am(?) till 10pm. But you wanna get down there before 9 to get the good stuff.  Breakfast isn't anything special, but its more then you get at any other hotel without paying! Its simple, there are croissants, small muffins, and rolls. (No toaster). Spreads: Butter and jams. Also a kettle for Tea, and a coffee machine (possibly instant coffee). I got in a routine in the morning of getting up about 7:30-8, walking to Starbucks 1 block away, and grabbing a croissant for me, and a muffin for my girl, and taking it back to our room for her breakfast in bed haha. Our room: We arrived about 2am in the morning, and lucked out and scored room 302 (bad room reviews from previous reviews). This room faces the street (that you enter off) and is 2 levels up. So there is a bit of traffic noise, dump trucks etc at night, and 1 of the nights there were road works outside all night. We use to live on a main road back home, so we were able to deal with the 'city noise'... But I can understand how others would be annoyed. If so, you are probably better off with a room with no view. (Who looks out the windows anyway?!) Also room 302 has a resident next door. Kind of a strange situation. I asked about this, and apparently 'he came with the hotel'. He doesnt make noise, and I assume is respectful to guests, but seems to be home all day, and smokes like a chimney. Thus the hall way does smell of smoke as soon as you step out the lift. Bed was ok, nothing amazing... I have to agree with previous people, the pillow were horrible. Rather thin and hard. 1 pillow wasn't enough, 2 was too much. And they were very stiff... Air Con worked fine when required. Bathroom was clean, shower was good, and soaps etc nice. House keeping does come very late some days. Shouldnt be an issue, unless you are hanging around in your room all day. They have a little envelope for tips.

It made it so easy to get about NYC and see all that we wanted to see. We were also delightfully surprised at how good the Hotel was, the room was gorgeous, lots of space in the room with a lovely soft, comfy double bed and a really nice and extremely clean bathroom. The Hotel staff were fantastic and any questions you had they were more than happy to assist. There are also two computers in reception for guests to use for free, which proved so beneficial to us to save money on booking things to do in NYC. The breakfast was basic, but exactly what was advised during booking and if your looking for a more substantial breakfast, your in NYC, there's lots of places just out the door. We arrived early on our first day but our room was ready in 20 minutes so we treated ourselves to lunch downstairs in Joe's restaurant which was also fab, great pizza!

The cost was relatively high though (over $200/night) but given the peak summer season (August) that can probably be expected. The hotel is ideally situated - only a short walk from Columbus circle and Central Park - with perhaps a 10min walk from 42nd street (Times Square and Broadway theaters). We would stay here again - but would check for specials first. The breakfast and coffee (low budget instant coffee) can really be improved for the price that this hotel charges - our tip, just skip the breakfast completely and walk to the Lenny's about 50m past the McDonalds in 55th Street - you won't be sorry!", "review_date": "August 28, 2012"},

The hotel staff is still friendly and non-intrusive, the rooms are still clean, the price is still right, and the area surrounding the hotel has actually gotten a lot nicer over the past five years. I also noticed a few new perks. The hotel now offers a very small free breakfast spread of generic-looking muffins, pastries, and coffee, but I cannot comment on the quality as I didn't partake. Oh, and they actually offer free wi-fi now! (We had to latch on to a neighboring signal back in 2007.) Now that I've lived not far from NYC for seven years and make somewhat frequent day and weekend trips, I've found that midtown is an area which I generally try to avoid. However, I don't really count the Da Vinci's midtown location as a bad thing - it is super close to a few subway stops, including Columbus Circle, and its proximity to Central Park is great for those of us who want to take a morning jog. And even a room on the third floor with street-facing windows was pretty quiet at night. I will definitely stay at the Da Vinci again and again, as long as it stays just how it is!

NYC is hard because all the hotels are just so expensive! I booked this one because it was reasonably priced for NYC, had decent reviews on Trip Advisor and was in a good location close to the park and was close to stations on three or four different coloured subway lines. Well, I was certainly not disappointed by the location. It was the PERFECT spot to stay in NYC. About a 2min walk to the southern end of Central Park, and there are two subway stations within 2min walk, even more within 5mins. Broadway is just around the corner, and a 3-5min walk puts you right in the middle of the theatre district and Times Square. We had no trouble catching the subway right downtown to visit Wall St, Ground Zero and the Statue of Liberty. We caught the train to midtown to see a jazz show and Harlem to go to church. All from stops within 2min walk from the hotel. The room was really quite decent. A little bit of an older style, but clean and comfortable with two queen size beds, and just enough room for our luggage. The bathroom was smallish, but clean and had everything we needed, including a nice hot shower. Just what one would expect from a hotel in this price range! The breakfast is very basic (muffins with juice and coffee), which I understand is pretty normal for NYC, but it was prefectly fine to start off the day, considering it was included in the price. The only drama we had was that, being winter, the boiler system in the building made a VERY loud banging noise which lasted about 1min each time. And the problem was that this happened about every hour or two. I wore ear plugs, but the noise was still loud enough to wake me up each time. I did complain to the front desk, but was told there were no other available rooms with two beds.

The bed was clean but you sunk into it over the night and it was not comfortable. Bathroom was clean but no soap apart from body wash, so take your own. A major drawback for me was that I went out everyday early and, despite me asking, the maid only came to clean the room at 4.45pm. I would get back tired and want to rest and find the room as I had left it and then have to leave to give them the chance to clean and tidy. Not good.The aircon was very noisy and was largely ineffectual as the room was continually hot. Breakfast was not good. Soggy croissants, dry bread rolls or a cup cake. Plus tea or coffee. Coffee was okay but if you want more there are many small restaurants nearby that would offer more substantial meals or, if desperate, there is Macca's next door. The positives. There are good rooms. A colleague of mine stayed here for one night and he got room 303 and it was fantastic. Twin beds, heaps of light and windows. Such a contrast to what I experienced. Staying a week I would have like a room such as this. Anna on the desk was lovely and very obliging. She always had a smile on her face. One other lass was not. Work appeared to be an effort.

We returned and went down the steps into the restaurant to find it practically empty but decided to stay and give it a go anyway. Our waiter arrived with our water and started the usual conversation - where are you from/been to NYC before/how long staying etc - but then things started turning slightly strange. As part of the normal run of things we asked him where he was from, to which he got us playing a guessing game (?!?) and then started giving us clues eg \"Your country has had problems with my country.\" Eventually he told us he was from Guatemala. As the meal progressed he seemed less friendly and kept telling us at various points in the evening about different problems between the UK and Guatemala, and how the UK has \"double crossed\" his country. Unfortunately both my wife and I had to admit our ignorance of these problems but his comments and behaviour were making us feel very uncomfortable. As we finished our main course we decided that we'd leave without enjoying any deserts or coffee, due to the waiter, however when we declined to see the desert menu he \"accidentally\" knocked an almost full glass of red wine all over my wife whilst taking her plate away. Obviously this made a mess of her dress, as well as being the final straw in THE most surreal and uncomfortable dining experience we have ever had anywhere in the world. We demanded our bill immediately and left (obviously without leaving a tip) - the guy we'd seen earlier (the owner ?) was sitting in a corner seat on his mobile but if he was the owner/manager as we suspected he didn't even break his call (ok he could have been a customer who'd been there for about 4 hours). The food itself was very average and relatively overpriced but the confrontational, unprofessional and weird waiter was disgraceful (and if it was the owner/manager he clearly didn't care about what was going on).

The restaurant on the bottom level served delicious food and gave a 15% discount to hotel guests ( a nice bonus). The hotel was quiet and a nice retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city. The location is terrific - only two blocks from Columbus Circle and Central Park, 10-12 short blocks from Times Square and close to many of the theatres. Two subway stops were two blocks or less from the hotel and covered most of the major lines. I can't say enough about this little jewel. When we go back to New York, and we will, this is definitely the hotel we will stay in. The price is a bargain for Manhattan but everything else is top notch.", "review_date": "November 23, 2010"},

Staff were average - not rude in any way, but not necessarily helpful. Ignore the offer of free breakfast - it's a meagre selection even if you're there early (6am), and by 9am it's down to plain bread rolls. Definitely eat at Joey G's below the hotel, for a convenient, tasty meal with friendly service.

I do have to give a poor rating to the rest. Here is my reason why.  We got there and the front desk came off a bit rude. When I walked in she just asked if we were checking in, no hello or how are you. As we were checking in, we found out that our room was not cleaned when we arrived way after check out. We were patient and asked if we can leave our luggages while we get a bite to eat. Her reply was you can leave it in the lobby. Are you serious? We decided that one should stay in the lobby while the other runs to McDonalds next door to get food. After an hour our room was ready. When we got in we were upset because we had the front rooms and they said that rooms are usually bigger in that end and it was small. We looked around to make sure it was clean, and ended up finding a roach. We went back downstairs and the front desk agent just shrugged and said thats New york. We asked if we can go to another room and she said she was able to do that. She said the manager was the only who could reassign rooms. We asked to speak to a manger and she said that the manager would be in at 11pm. We asked if there was any other time he'll be in and she said \"No, he does night audit\". So we asked for maintenance and she said fine. We waited when maintenace came up he had a cook outfit on. We were a little confused, but we remembered that they had a restaurant below the hotel (same owner). We decided to skip the restaurant downstairs, even with a 10% discount, I dont want to even know. What he did do was sprayed some bug spray (thanks). That night we saw the manager and complained. His response was a shrug. The followng day we woke up and noticed bite marks on our body. We finally had it and asked to speak with someone else. Another girl at the front desk asked for the owner and the owner himself didn't have a response. It seemed as if he didn't know much either or how to manage a hotel. We complained to him about the service and the room. We asked that we get our money back and he said no, but he'll gve us a free meal and we said hell no. We also told him why. We decided we weren't going to stay.

The reservation was made directly with the hotel a couple of months in advance over the phone. It took several additional calls to ensure we had a booking and eventually the hotel sent an email confirmation (which for some reason had 'modification' at the top and was odd since this was the first communication from the hotel). At no time on the phone was there mention of their cancellation policy and it was hidden in the reams of information at the bottom of the email they sent. In addition the rate we were quoted was $329 for the first two nights and then dropping to $209 for the next night and then $289 for the rest of the stay (a total of 6 nights in all). Overall an average of $289 per night. Their cancellation policy states one night penalty and yes you have guessed it, instead of the average or even the lowest we were charged $329 cancellation fee. Their policy states that any change or cancellation within 7 days of arrival has a one night penalty and I called them 4 days ahead of arrival to cancel. I was told that if I spoke to the manager he may be able to reduce the fee but I made several calls to try to speak to him and was told every time that the manager was either off duty and would be in at 11pm (NY time) or was unavailable. I also tried to email the manger but never got a response from him. The only other communication I received from the hotel was that they had charged my card the $329. My recommendation is to avoid this hotel if at all possible unless you are absolutely sure you won't have to cancel within the 7 days prior to arrival.", "review_date": "December 8, 2008"},

Check-in was quick, friendly and efficient and check-out was also the same. Times Sq is in walking distance and about one block over are a million places to eat breakfast (Fluffy's, Carnegie, Park).

If you are coming in from Penn Station, you can take the blue line C train 3 stops up to Columbus circle($2 one way)  Now for the hotel itself. Do not expect luxury at this hotel. This is strictly what I would call a tourist 2 star hotel. NYC is expensive so to get a hotel for under $200/night in this location you can't expect much. The room is small, big enough for a queen size bed and a small (very small) desk. They did manage to put a small wardrobe with a frig which I thought is convenient to keep drinks cold and there is space to hang-up shirts. The bathroom decor was nice w/small shower stall, toilet and pedestal sink just as you see in the pictures on this site. The room was clean and the bathroom was spotless.  However, I must mention one mishap when we were getting ready to leave our room to check out. There was a cockroach in the bathroom on the floor at the base of the pedastal sink. We were on the 3rd fl and roaches usually make their way up from the ground so it had to make us wonder what was going on in the basement.

We\u2019d done it all & there was no hot water. No offer to send help. 2nd call, \u201cH & C reversed. Move handle to C, you\u2019ll have hot water.\u201d Apparently thought I was lying about having done all that & no hot water. No offer to send help.  Go to desk to talk to clerk personally. Says lack of hot water is not her fault. Maybe a prior guest moved the handle incorrectly. Still no offer to help. She insists there is hot water (if I weren\u2019t so stupid) & draws a picture of how to turn the handle so C is actually H. Duh. Can you say, \u201cMr Guest, you\u2019re a moron.\u201d? STILL no offer to send help. Of course, all my efforts to receive hot water fail. Skip bath/shower to make dinner res. On way out, after much continued arguing, she says she\u2019ll send someone to look at it while we are gone. Next a.m. try to shower &, lo & behold, STILL no hot water. After expressing outrage to a different desk person, she says she\u2019ll send someone to help. Shortly, housekeepers arrive & after just a few minutes of yakking, huffing & puffing, we have hot water. Seems one of the two dials of the two-dial mixing system was frozen in place. (We had told the desk persons that we, including my 275-lb self, had tried to move the inner dial but couldn\u2019t & feared pulling it out of the wall.)  On the way out now unfortunately much later in the morning, we were confronted by both the desk women. The first gets in our faces, not to apologize for treating us like morons & for not providing customer service, but to express her anger at us \u2013 her customers \u2013 that we could possibly have thought she was treating us like morons. A heated & loud discussion ensued, with both the women telling us this: providing us with hot water was not their jobs & if we had a problem we should have talked to the manager (not present) or the owner (not known).

I had heard that hotels in NYC are famous for overbooking. (I had also read a few reviews about this specific hotel stating that others had had this problem here). I stayed in the city the previous August and was almost a victim of this at another hotel. I had no problems this time. I am not sure if it was because a) it was the middle of the week and the middle of winter or b) I had booked it through Travelocity, which means I had paid for the entire room/stay at the time of booking. I can't imagine that they can overbook you out of a room when you've already paid for the whole thing. Anyways, about the hotel - it was pretty nice for the price. Room was small as to be expected but it looked as if it had been updated within the last 10 years or so. The only irritating thing that I found was that there is an old hot water heater-type pipe that runs up the wall in one corner of the room. It made loud noises all night. I am a light sleeper and had a hard time sleeping with this nagging noise. AWESOME location. We ate at the restaurant that is in the basement (I believe it is owned by the same proprieter).

The hotel is situated next door to a busy McDonalds and has a variety of other restaurants close by. The exterior is pleasant and the reception was welcoming and warm, especially so as the weather was freezing during our 5 night stay. Our reservation was quickly processed and we were pleased with Room 401. The room had ample storage space, was clean and tidy and the bathroom was fine with a good supply of fresh towels and complimentary toiletries. The double bed was comfortable and linen was changed once during our stay. A no-charge safe was in the wardrobe but as it was not bolted down many would think a determined intruder would be free to take it away - but it was heavy! Other furnishings included a writing desk and stool, an armchair, flat screen TV, radio/clock alarm and a small fridge.   The view from the window over the crossroads of 56th & 8th Avenue didn\u2019t inspire but the sounds from the city that never sleeps did creep through the air-conditioning unit but after a full days activity sleep was not a problem. The room was well heated. The included breakfast of assorted bread rolls, doughnuts, muffins and croissants was not the most healthy or weight conscious way to start the day but the coffee was always welcome. Free internet access in reception is also a bonus. We used Joe G\u2019s hotel restaurant on our first night and the food and atmosphere were excellent but a word of warning. Whether in error or not a 15% discount (from reception or website) was not calculated correctly and also a hefty 18% gratuity was added as standard to the bill (this may be to counteract the discount) the bill was amended with apologies but it is wise to check your bill in all restaurants. Overall the Da Vinci is an excellent base for all that New York offers. I recommend it as good value for money. Enjoy your stay. TRAVEL TIP We purchased the $24 7 day unlimited MTA pass at JFK (Airtrain ticket 5$ extra) on arrival and used it for the 1 hour approx direct journey to Columbus Circle leaving us with just a few minutes walk to the Da Vinci.

I felt that the room size was fine, my wife found it a little small (about 300sqf) but to tell you the truth I do not know many people who visit NYC to stay in their hotel room. The queen size bed was comfortable, the sheets were clean, we had a flat screen TV with several channels, the bathroom was clean and updated: new tiles, toilet and sink: they were actually installing the sink when we arrived and offered us free drinks in the restaurant attached to the hotel as compensation. There was a small closet, chair and a dresser in the room as well. The room had a AC unit that worked but I would suggest brining a pair of pliers to turn the controls as the knob was missing (hint: you have the flip the light switch above the AC unit to turn it on). Do not expect a view, ours was a the rear of 3 other buildings. While NYC can be loud at night we did not have any noise issues in our room.  We did not experience any issues with the staff at the Da Vinci like some reviewers mentioned. The front desk staff said hello when they saw us were helpful when asked questions.  If you like doughnuts and coffee for breakfast then you'll love their continental breakfast, if not spend the extra 5$ for a bagel and coffee somewhere more picturesque during your trip (don't forget your paying 100$ less a night to stay here, so now your only up $95). There are several Starbucks close by and we found a good place for breakfast on 8th and 50th.  The hotel is on 56th Street between 8th & Broadway: EXCELLENT MIDTOWN LOCATION. Subway stations are a  5 min walk: 8th & 59th: Columbus Circle. The Subway station has connections to all of Manhattan lines, thus truly only a few minutes from all of Manhattan.

It looks a little scruffy on the outside, but once inside, it is a nice little place. As you enter the lobby, you have the stairs leading up to the floors. Also, you have a narrow hallway, with a glass door leading to the first level elevator. The doors are always open to the elevator, so you just go in.   When I got to my 2nd floor room, I noticed the hallway was quite narrow. You use a plastic room card to access your room. I was surprised to have gotten two full size beds. There was just enough from from the door, outside in, to move my two main pieces of luggage. Inside was a clean and functional room with: two print pieces on the wall, an old desk with a fold down mirror, facing the main mirror, a television set with a two drawer cabinet and a larger one below that. There is a small closet, which had just enough capacity for my two medium sized luggage pieces. Inside the closet, was a top shelf with two blankets and one pillow. The beds had their own pillows.  Luckily, I didn't have room facing street traffic. My frosted window faced the wall of the building next door, so you could hear bits of conversation downstairs and could definitely detect food smells nearby.  There is a step down connecting the room to the bathroom, so watch out for that. The bathroom was lovely, with antique looking hot and cold water levers (?) by the sink. You did have a row of toiletries (those samples of shampoo and conditioner) on the glass shelf above the sink. The bathroom also has a combination tub / shower. The shower sliding door was located above the tub, sliding from left to right. It seemed functional enough.   The only thing I didn't like was the AC unit. I was unable to use it, since the knobs didn't have their coverings and I forgot to pack my pliers to turn on the unit. I was disappointed in that, since during that week, the temps in the afternoon were in the high 80's and I was sweating a bit. Also, try to work the clock radio and adjust the alarm if you don't want to be awakened at a certain time in the morning.   The staff at the Da Vinci were lovely. I had to borrow the iron and board from downstairs. Since those things have been used quite a bit, the dial info on the appliances have faded, so I recommend that you don't put water in the iron. You do get one of those small , not too long ironing boards, but I managed to press some of my clothes. You request the iron and board. It makes sense to return it as soon as you are done, so someone else can use them.   Surroundings: You have a McDonalds next door and an Italian restaurant below the hotel itself. The 59th St. Columbus Circle subway is about 3 blocks away to the north, right by Central Park South. The 50th St. 8th Avenue stop is about 6 blocks to the south of the hotel. I recommend the Cosmic Diner on W. 52nd and 8th Avenue, located at the SE corner of that intersection. It's a 24 hour place.   Suggestions: Keep an eagle eye ( a very close eye) on the traffic as you cross the lights. Cabs and other cars use the streets of Manhattan as a personal highway, so be warned. Also, even though the crosswalk light may be red, if the traffic is clear enough , people will cross. Pedestrian traffic is heavy, so you have to learn how to walk at a brisk pace... in other words... learn to walk fast.   There is a continental breakfast that starts around 6:30 a.m. or 7:00 a.m. I made the mistake of having a donut and coffee before my Super Shuttle arrived a couple of hours later. Bad choice. I don't know if it was the donut or the milk carton (at room temperature and not sitting in ice) that caused problems iwth my head and tummy. I didn't experience that during my first trip and had eaten a full breakfast. It didn't help that the Super Shuttle was making stops here and there before it got to JFK.  It could have been.. just me.. but I have my suspicions about that donut and the coffee.   My stay at the Da Vinci was generally okay. I wouldn't recommend the donuts and coffee tho. I actually took a bunch of pics as I arrived in my room, on the first day. I hope you enjoy YOUR trip to the Big Apple.", "review_date": "June 2, 2007"},

Whilst at the price and the great location I was not expecting the Waldorf, I was expecting a little more than what we got. The room was very very small and dark. There was a tiny window which would not open, this meant the room felt so depressing. In the first hour, we found that the bedside lamp was broken, the fridge didn't work and the TV reception was terrible even the basic cable. The TV and lamp were met with no assistance, the fridge we fixed ourselves. I noted that many people found the reception staff good. On weekdays she seemed pleasant enough, not overly friendly but not rude. The weekend staff were terrible. We asked where the nearest laundromat was, only to be told \"I don't know\". Therefore we searched along 8th Avenue for a internet cafe to look one up. Shame the girl on the desk didn't feel able to do this for us. The cleaning staff were nice, but 2 days out of 5 it wasn't done as we were in the room at 4pm (jetlag). Many reviews are correct in that it was relatively clean and cheap for Manhattan. I would recommend spending another $50 a night and staying somewhere where you can move, that has daylight, and helpful staff!", "review_date": "January 28, 2007"},

I have to say for the price, I really think this was a great hotel. It's certainly not the Hilton but if you are going to NYC for 2 nights to shop why would you want to pay so much money for a hotel which you are never in. I really think this was great for the money we paid. We stayed in a one bed room on the first floor. The bedding was clean and nice. The bathroom was marble and very clean. The shower was quite powerful and the bath was clean. I think if you are looking for a cheap hotel, then as long as it's clean then you cant go wrong.  The lady on reception was always very polite and helpful. She helped lot's with booking my return travel and also find the bus times for woodbury outlet centre. Which I have to add is a really good place to go. It's about an hour outside the City by Bus and the return ticket is about $38.00. It's well worth the visit, there are such great bargains. I would actually recommend visiting here before you hit the other shops in the City because I did see the same watch I bought from the outlets in a Macy's and it was the full price, so it's not even like they are selling old stock. If you also go to the information centre when you get there, you can pick a discount book for most of the stores. Sorry going off track abit here. Anyway the hotel is also in a really good location, a few blocks from time square and also a short walk to 5th Ave. Overall I had a really enjoyable stay here and wold def stay again.", "review_date": "December 4, 2006"},

I contacted the hotel immediately to have the number of nights changed to two. The next e-mail they sent had me confirmed for only one night. I called again to have the reservation changed to the two nights. Finally, on the third try they got it right! About a week later they left me a message saying that they did not have any availability and had to cancel my reservation. No explanation was given as to why they could not honor a confirmed reservation and the staff was upapologetic about the whole situation. This level of customer service is upacceptable.

The area around the hotel is fairly lively, there are restuarants and shops close by and we felt safe walking around there at night time. We also used the subway at night and felt very safe doing so. A tip for seeing broadway shows: don't go to the TKTS booth in Times Square, go to the one at the South Sea Terminal. The one in Times Square always has a massive queue, but we managed to walk straight into the other one with no queue at all.
